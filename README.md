This repository contains `Analytics Vidhya` hackathon May-2021 problem solution. 

Link for the problem statement and leaderboard is here: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/job-a-thon-2/

I have used highly advanced (as of May 2021) tree based machine learning algorithms viz `Light Gradient Boost` and `CatBoost` to solve this problem. The final solution includes blend of both these algorithms which is giving very competitive results on evaluation metrics.

For more details on data sets please checkout the above link or this repository also contains both train and test data.

Happy Solving..!
